# KnowledgeHut: Infrastructure with Terraform
This repository contains code used in exercises that are part of KnowledgeHut's Infrastructure with Terraform course.  The code samples used in excercises for each of the course modules are included in subdirectories.

## How to Use
You should use this code when performing the course activities.  It will allow you to follow along with the instruction and execute the examples.  It is strongly recommended that you fork this project and use the code using one of the following methods.

1. *GitHub Codespaces* - With this approach, you are using a variation of the VS Code editor in your borwser by way of [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview).  You can read further about GitHub Codespaces in the [service documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview).

1. *Clone to your local system* - This method requires that you have the assumed tooling installed on your local system (git, Terraform, AWS CLI, etc.).  Please refer to comments in the [Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile) for a full inventory of the assumed tooling.  With this approach, you clone the repository to your local system, navigate the code using an editor of choice installed on your system, and perform the excercises described in the course.
