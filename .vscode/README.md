# VS Code Settings Meta-data
This directory contains meta-data files that conigure [VS Code settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings).  

Specifics about VSCode and this capability are beyond scope of the course, but you can certainly do self-study to understand more about this capability.  Putting common IDE settings in your repo is a practice I highly recommend to simplify management of development environments across a team of people contributing to a common codebase.
