# Dev Containers Meta-data
This directory contains meta-data files that VS Code uses to configure the [devcontainers plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).  

Specifics about VSCode and this capability are beyond scope of the course, but you can certainly do self-study to understand more about this capability.  It is something I highly recommend to simplify management of development environments across a team of people contributing to a common codebase.
