# Terraform Test

Simple Terraform file to demonstrate your environment is working.

Run these commands in the terminal windows to confirm Terraform is working.
*All commands assume your working directory is the same directory as this README file*

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The outputs are judgement of success.  The final lines of output from running the second command should look like this:

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

hello_terraform = "Hello, Terraform!"
```
